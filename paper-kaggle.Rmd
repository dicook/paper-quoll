# Introduction

Kaggle is well-known for the richly funded data competitinns, where participants compete to score the lowest error in their model fitting. Recently, they have made it possible to run in-class competitions, private and limited to members of a university course. This work explores how student participation in these challenges improves performance, engagement, interest
